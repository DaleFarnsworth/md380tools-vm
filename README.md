MD380tools VM for VirtualBox
Warren Merkel, KD4Z
Current Version: 2.21

This project is a fork of https://github.com/kd0kkv/md380tools-vm

You could freshly install any Linux distribution you like in VirtualBox, 
however I recently ran across the image made by KD0KKV, and thought it was useful.

I created this fork to enhance the image to support MD-390 radios with GPS and
provide more detailed instructions in its use.

Follow directions in the installation PDF found here:
https://github.com/KD4Z/md380tools-vm/blob/master/MD380tools_VM_installation.pdf

You will need to download the VirtualBox Appliance image file from Dropbox.

The file is also available split into four parts.
Here are the links for each piece:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24789865/VM/tyt_kd4z.part4.rar

Download each one.  You will need to use the RAR program to extract them
back into the original OVA Appliance file.
