MD380tools VM for VirtualBox
Warren Merkel, KD4Z
Current Version: 2.21

This project is a fork of md380tools-vm by kd0kkv

You could freshly install any Linux distribution you like in VirtualBox, 
however I recently ran across the image made by KD0KKV, and thought it was useful.

I created this fork to enhance the image to support MD-390 radios with GPS and
provide more detailed instructions in its use.  A simple single-word menu has 
been extended to support offline flashing of firmware and contact data.  And
now you can add private DMR IDs to the UsersCSV.

Follow directions in the installation PDF found here in the github project:

You will need to download the VirtualBox Appliance image file from Dropbox.

The file is also available split into four parts.
Here are the links for each piece:

Download each one.  You will need to use the RAR program to extract them
back into the original OVA Appliance file.
