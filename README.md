MD380tools VM for VirtualBox
Warren Merkel, KD4Z

This project is a fork of https://github.com/kd0kkv/md380tools-vm

You could freshly install any Linux distribution you like in VirtualBox, 
however I recently ran across the image made by KD0KKV, and thought it was useful.

I created this fork to enhance the image to support MD-390 radios with GPS and
provide more detailed instructions in its use.

You will need to download the VirtualBox Appliance image file from Dropbox.

Follow directions in the installation PDF.
