MD380tools VM for VirtualBox
Warren Merkel, KD4Z

This project is a fork of https://github.com/kd0kkv/md380tools-vm

You could freshly install any Linux distribution you like in VirtualBox, 
however I recently ran across the image made by KD0KKV, and thought it was useful.

I created this fork to enhance the image to support MD-390 radios with GPS and
provide more detailed instructions in its use.

Follow directions in the installation PDF.

You will need to download the VirtualBox Appliance image file from Dropbox.

The file is also available split into four parts.
Here are the links for each piece:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24789865/VM/tyt_kd4z.part3.rar
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24789865/VM/tyt_kd4z.part4.rar

Download each one.  You will need to use the RAR program to extract them
back into the original OVA file.
